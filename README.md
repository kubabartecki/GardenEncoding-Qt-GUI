## Utility
Program encodes a field of objects (here radishes) into short code.

Decoding comes in opposite way.

## Description
Field is represented as square, which side is equal 2^n. 

In manual mode n can be from 1 to 6.

In field modes n can be from 1 to 15(this value may be heigher but calcualtions becomes slower).

## Rules

## 3 ways of usage
* Manual

  In this mode you can click on the radishes to change the field appearance.
  Also you can write code in edit text.
  
* Files with multiple fields/codes

  Reads fields or codes from file -> saves result to file and show it in GUI
  
* Files with one field/code
